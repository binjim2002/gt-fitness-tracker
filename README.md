# Description

 The FITNESSTRACKER app is an amazing application that I have designed to help our users track, store and keep an eye on the amount and kind of workout that they have had. It is similar to what we know as a fitbit but then it gives you some  more functions and options. This app will help users for instance if they want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they should be able to track my distance traveled. 

# Installation

Clone the repository from heroku. Open the file the output folder and the open the server.js by simply running node server.js, and finally press and hold the CTRL key and clicking on http://localhost:3000.

# Usage
Using the FITNESSTRACKER app is easy and simple. As soon as you open the app, you'll be propmt to the welcome page with two options : New Workout and continue workout.
You will need to select new workout. Once you do that, you will then be prompt to a page asking you the select the type of workouts that you want to perform and so on and you can begin to enjoy your app.
